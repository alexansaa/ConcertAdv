# World Tour Concerts <a name="about-project"></a>

**Hello Microverse** is a HTML, CSS and JavaScript project that displays two pages: "Home" and "About" Pages. This two are ment to be the main interface for users who want to follow and learn about the "world tour concert" performed by different bands across the world. This series of concerts has the main feature that englobes different kinds of music, ranging from pop to heavy metal. Technologycal features have been implemented in the developent of the web site. The main page has been developed mainly with html and css, but the rendering of music kinds integrating the concert uses JavaScript objects to dinamically implements elements. The list of bands included in the concert is also implemented with JavaScript objects.

JavaScript have been also used for implementing the click events on different buttons and elements across the pages, for example, clicking the logo may send you to the home page. Clicking the About link may send you to the corresponding page. JavaSript has also been used for implementing the logic behind clicking the more button in the bands section.

One main breakpoint was implemented for aproaching responsibility over 768px of viewport width. This means that media queries were used for page responsiveness.

The design behind the web pages was developed previously by Cindy Shin in Behance.
